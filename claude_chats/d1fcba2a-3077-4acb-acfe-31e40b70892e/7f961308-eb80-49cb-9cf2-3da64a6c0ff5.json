  "text": " To understand why there's a delay in loading the messages, let's review the relevant parts of the code:\n\n<CODE_REVIEW>\n1. The main component handling chat messages is `ChatMessages.tsx`.\n2. It uses the `useChat` hook from the `ai/react` library to manage the chat state and interactions.\n3. The component also uses the `useQuery` hook from `@tanstack/react-query` to fetch initial messages.\n4. The fetched messages are used as `initialMessages` for the `useChat` hook.\n5. There's a loading state (`isLoading`) managed by the `useQuery` hook.\n6. The `MessageList` component receives the `messages` and `isLoading` props.\n\nThe delay in loading messages is likely due to the asynchronous nature of fetching the initial messages from the server. The `useQuery` hook is making an API call to `/api/get-messages` to retrieve the chat history.\n</CODE_REVIEW>\n\nThe delay you're experiencing is actually a good thing in terms of user experience. It allows the application to show a loading state while fetching the messages, rather than showing an empty chat or no content at all.\n\nTo improve the user experience further, we can consider the following steps:\n\n<PLANNING>\n1. Optimize the backend API (`/api/get-messages`) to return messages as quickly as possible.\n2. Implement a skeleton loader or placeholder content while messages are being fetched.\n3. Consider implementing infinite scrolling or pagination for large chat histories.\n4. Use caching strategies to store and quickly retrieve recent messages.\n5. Implement optimistic updates for new messages to appear instantly while being sent to the server.\n</PLANNING>\n\nLet's start by implementing a skeleton loader to improve the perceived performance. We'll modify the `MessageList` component to show placeholder content while loading.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n\n```tsx\nimport { cn } from \"@/lib/utils\";\nimport { Message } from \"ai/react\";\nimport { Loader2 } from \"lucide-react\";\nimport React from \"react\";\n\ntype Props = {\n  messages: Message[];\n  isLoading: boolean;\n};\n\nconst MessageList = ({ messages, isLoading }: Props) => {\n  if (isLoading) {\n    return (\n      <div className=\"flex flex-col gap-2 px-4\">\n        {[...Array(3)].map((_, i) => (\n          <div\n            key={i}\n            className={cn(\n              \"flex\",\n              i % 2 === 0 ? \"justify-end\" : \"justify-start\"\n            )}\n          >\n            <div\n              className={cn(\n                \"rounded-lg px-3 text-sm py-1 shadow-md ring-1 ring-gray-900/10\",\n                i % 2 === 0 ? \"bg-blue-600\" : \"bg-gray-100\"\n              )}\n            >\n              <div className=\"animate-pulse h-4 w-20 bg-gray-300 rounded\"></div>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        ))}\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n\n  if (!messages || messages.length === 0) {\n    return (\n      <div className=\"flex justify-center items-center h-full\">\n        <p className=\"text-gray-500\">No messages yet. Start a conversation!</p>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div className=\"flex flex-col gap-2 px-4\">\n      {messages.map((message) => {\n        return (\n          <div\n            key={message.id}\n            className={cn(\"flex\", {\n              \"justify-end pl-10\": message.role === \"user\",\n              \"justify-start pr-10\": message.role === \"assistant\",\n            })}\n          >\n            <div\n              className={cn(\n                \"rounded-lg px-3 text-sm py-1 shadow-md ring-1 ring-gray-900/10\",\n                {\n                  \"bg-blue-600 text-white\": message.role === \"user\",\n                }\n              )}\n            >\n              <p>{message.content}</p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        );\n      })}\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default MessageList;\n```\n\n</OUTPUT>\n\nThis updated `MessageList` component now includes a skeleton loader that displays three placeholder message bubbles while the content is loading. It also handles the case where there are no messages yet.\n\nTo test this change:\n\n1. Implement the updated `MessageList` component.\n2. Run your application and navigate to a chat.\n3. Observe the loading state - you should see placeholder message bubbles while the messages are being fetched.\n4. Once loaded, you should see the actual messages replace the placeholders.\n5. Try clearing your browser cache or using a new chat to see the loading state again.\n\nThis improvement should make the loading process feel smoother and give users immediate feedback that content is being loaded. The perceived performance should be better, even if the actual loading time remains the same.\n\n<SECURITY_REVIEW>\nThe changes made to the MessageList component do not introduce any security vulnerabilities. The component is purely presentational and doesn't handle any sensitive data or user inputs directly. However, always ensure that message content is properly sanitized before rendering to prevent XSS attacks, especially if messages can contain user-generated content or HTML.\n</SECURITY_REVIEW>",
