  "text": " I apologize for the oversight. It seems the `streamText` function doesn't return an object with a `lastMessage` property as we expected. Let's modify our approach to capture the AI's response correctly.\n\n<PLANNING>\n1. Use the `onCompletion` callback in the `streamText` function to capture the full AI response.\n2. Save the AI message to the database within this callback.\n3. Ensure we're still returning the stream for the frontend to consume.\n4. Keep error handling in place for database operations.\n</PLANNING>\n\nLet's implement these changes:\n\n<OUTPUT>\n\nUpdate the `/api/chat/route.ts` file:\n\n```typescript\nimport { text } from \"drizzle-orm/pg-core\";\nimport { getContext } from \"@/lib/context\";\nimport { db } from \"@/lib/db\";\nimport { chats, messages as _messages } from \"@/lib/db/schema\";\nimport { createOpenAI } from \"@ai-sdk/openai\";\nimport { Message, streamText } from \"ai\";\nimport { eq } from \"drizzle-orm\";\nimport { NextResponse } from \"next/server\";\n\nexport const runtime = \"edge\";\n\nconst openai = createOpenAI({\n  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY!,\n});\n\nconst model = openai.chat(\"gpt-4o-mini\", {});\n\nexport async function POST(req: Request) {\n  try {\n    const { messages, chatId } = await req.json();\n    const _chats = await db.select().from(chats).where(eq(chats.id, chatId));\n\n    console.log(`Searching for chat with ID: ${chatId}`);\n    console.log(`Found ${_chats.length} chats`);\n\n    const fileKey = _chats[0].fileKey;\n    if (!fileKey) {\n      throw new Error(\"api/chat/route.ts, No fileKey found\");\n    } else {\n      console.log(\"fileKey found\", fileKey);\n    }\n\n    const lastMessage = messages[messages.length - 1];\n    console.log(\"last message\", lastMessage.content.toString());\n\n    // Save user message to the database\n    try {\n      await db.insert(_messages).values({\n        chatId, \n        content: lastMessage.content, \n        role: \"user\"\n      });\n      console.log(\"User message saved into db\");\n    } catch (error) {\n      console.error(\"Error saving user message to db:\", error);\n    }\n\n    const context = await getContext(lastMessage.content.toString(), fileKey);\n    console.log(\"Context received:\", context.toString());\n\n    const systemMessage = {\n      role: \"system\",\n      content: `AI assistant is a brand new, powerful, human-like artificial intelligence.\n      The traits of AI include expert knowledge, helpfulness, cleverness, and articulateness.\n      AI is a well-behaved and well-mannered individual.\n      AI is always friendly, kind, and inspiring, and he is eager to provide vivid and thoughtful responses to the user.\n      AI has the sum of all knowledge in their brain, and is able to accurately answer nearly any question about any topic in conversation.\n      AI assistant is a big fan of Pinecone and Vercel.\n      START CONTEXT BLOCK\n      ${context}\n      END OF CONTEXT BLOCK\n      AI assistant will take into account any CONTEXT BLOCK that is provided in a conversation.\n      If the context does not provide the answer to question, the AI assistant will say, \"I'm sorry, but I don't know the answer to that question\".\n      AI assistant will not apologize for previous responses, but instead will indicated new information was gained.\n      AI assistant will not invent anything that is not drawn directly from the context.\n      `,\n    };\n\n    let aiMessageContent = '';\n\n    const response = await streamText({\n      model,\n      messages: [\n        systemMessage,\n        ...messages.filter((message: Message) => message.role === \"user\"),\n      ],\n      onCompletion: async (completion) => {\n        aiMessageContent = completion;\n        // Save AI message to the database\n        try {\n          await db.insert(_messages).values({\n            chatId, \n            content: completion, \n            role: \"system\"\n          });\n          console.log(\"AI message saved into db\");\n        } catch (error) {\n          console.error(\"Error saving AI message to db:\", error);\n        }\n      }\n    });\n    \n    return response.toAIStreamResponse();\n\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error(\n      \"Error in route.ts (app/api/chat) with the ai stream:\",\n      error\n    );\n    return NextResponse.json(\n      { error: \"An error occurred with ai stream\" },\n      { status: 500 }\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\n</OUTPUT>\n\nThis implementation makes the following changes:\n\n1. Removed the attempt to access `response.lastMessage`.\n2. Added an `onCompletion` callback to the `streamText` function.\n3. Inside the `onCompletion` callback, we save the AI's complete response to the database.\n4. We still return the stream response for the frontend to consume.\n5. Error handling remains in place for database operations.\n\n<SECURITY_REVIEW>\n1. Input Validation: The implementation still assumes that `chatId` and `lastMessage.content` are safe to use directly in database operations. It would be prudent to add input validation for these values before using them in database queries.\n\n2. Error Handling: The try-catch blocks for database operations prevent errors from breaking the chat functionality. However, they only log the errors and don't notify the user. Consider adding a mechanism to inform the user if their message couldn't be saved.\n\n3. Data Sanitization: The `lastMessage.content` and `completion` are inserted into the database without explicit sanitization. Ensure that your ORM (Drizzle in this case) properly handles SQL injection prevention.\n\n4. Authentication: The code assumes that the user is authenticated and authorized to access the chat with the given `chatId`. Ensure that proper authentication and authorization checks are in place before this point.\n\n5. Rate Limiting: There's no visible rate limiting on this endpoint. Consider implementing rate limiting to prevent abuse.\n\n6. HTTPS: Ensure that all communications with this API endpoint are over HTTPS to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the messages.\n\n7. Logging: Be cautious about what is being logged. The current implementation logs the last message content and context, which could potentially expose sensitive information in logs.\n\n8. Edge Runtime: This function is set to use the Edge runtime. Ensure that all operations, especially database operations, are compatible with Edge runtime constraints. Some database operations might not work in an edge environment, so thorough testing is crucial.\n\n9. Asynchronous Operations: The `onCompletion` callback is asynchronous, but the `streamText` function might not wait for it to complete before returning the stream. This could potentially lead to race conditions where the stream is returned before the database operation is complete.\n</SECURITY_REVIEW>\n\nTo test these changes:\n\n1. Send a few messages through the chat interface.\n2. Check the server logs for any errors or the success messages \"User message saved into db\" and \"AI message saved into db\".\n3. Verify in your Neon database that both user and AI messages are being saved correctly.\n\nThis implementation should now correctly save both user and AI messages to the Neon database while maintaining the streaming functionality of the chat. The AI's response is captured in its entirety before being saved to the database.\n\nIf you encounter any issues or need further adjustments, please let me know. Also, given the edge runtime constraints, we might need to consider moving the database operations to a separate API route if they prove incompatible with the edge environment.",
