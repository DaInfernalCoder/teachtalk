  "text": " Certainly! I'll review the code and suggest fixes for any font-related issues. Let's start with a code review to identify the problem areas.\n\n<CODE_REVIEW>\nAfter reviewing the provided code files, I don't see any specific issues with fonts in the code itself. However, there might be some font-related issues in the application's styling or rendering. The main areas where fonts are defined or could be affecting the appearance are:\n\n1. In `src/app/globals.css`, there's a Tailwind configuration that sets up some font-related CSS variables.\n2. In `src/app/layout.tsx`, the Inter font is imported and applied to the body.\n3. The `tailwind.config.ts` file extends the theme with a sans font family.\n\nThese are the standard ways of setting up fonts in a Next.js application with Tailwind CSS. If you're experiencing \"weird fonts,\" it might be due to how these fonts are being loaded or applied in the browser.\n</CODE_REVIEW>\n\n<PLANNING>\nTo address the font issues, we'll take the following steps:\n\n1. Ensure the Inter font is properly loaded and applied.\n2. Update the Tailwind configuration to use a more robust font stack.\n3. Add a preconnect link for Google Fonts to improve font loading performance.\n4. Apply the font consistently across the application.\n\nLet's implement these changes step by step.\n</PLANNING>\n\nLet's start with the first two steps. We'll modify the `src/app/layout.tsx` and `tailwind.config.ts` files.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n\nFirst, let's update `src/app/layout.tsx`:\n\n```typescript\nimport { Inter } from \"next/font/google\";\n\nconst inter = Inter({ \n  subsets: [\"latin\"],\n  display: 'swap',\n  variable: '--font-inter',\n});\n\nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode;\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\" className={inter.variable}>\n      <head>\n        <link\n          rel=\"preconnect\"\n          href=\"https://fonts.gstatic.com\"\n          crossOrigin=\"anonymous\"\n        />\n      </head>\n      <body className={`font-sans ${inter.className}`}>{children}</body>\n    </html>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nNow, let's update `tailwind.config.ts`:\n\n```typescript\nimport type { Config } from 'tailwindcss'\nimport { fontFamily } from \"tailwindcss/defaultTheme\"\n\nconst config: Config = {\n  // ... other configurations\n  theme: {\n    extend: {\n      fontFamily: {\n        sans: ['var(--font-inter)', ...fontFamily.sans],\n      },\n      // ... other theme extensions\n    },\n  },\n  // ... other configurations\n}\n\nexport default config\n```\n</OUTPUT>\n\nThese changes will ensure that the Inter font is properly loaded and applied consistently across your application. The `preconnect` link in the `<head>` will improve font loading performance.\n\nLet's test these changes:\n\n1. Run your application and check if the fonts appear correctly now.\n2. Inspect the page in your browser's developer tools and verify that the Inter font is being applied to the body and other elements.\n\nIf you're still experiencing issues or if you'd like to make further adjustments, please let me know, and we can continue refining the font setup.",
