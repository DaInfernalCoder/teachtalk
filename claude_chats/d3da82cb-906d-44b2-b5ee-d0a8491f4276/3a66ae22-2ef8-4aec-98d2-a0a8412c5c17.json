  "text": " To add a \"voice\" feature that speaks back responses, we'll need to integrate text-to-speech functionality into the chat interface. Let's review the existing code and plan the implementation.\n\n<CODE_REVIEW>\nThe current implementation uses a ChatMessages component (src\\components\\ChatMessages.tsx) to handle the chat interface. It includes:\n\n1. A message list to display chat history\n2. An input field for user queries\n3. A submit button to send messages\n\nThe component uses the useChat hook from the 'ai/react' library to manage chat state and communication with the API. Messages are displayed using the MessageList component.\n\nThe chat functionality is integrated into a larger page layout (src\\app\\chat\\[chatId]\\page.tsx) that includes a sidebar and PDF viewer.\n</CODE_REVIEW>\n\n<PLANNING>\nTo add a voice feature, we'll need to:\n\n1. Implement a text-to-speech (TTS) function using the Web Speech API, which is widely supported in modern browsers.\n2. Add a button to trigger voice playback for each assistant message.\n3. Update the ChatMessages and MessageList components to include the new voice feature.\n4. Implement a global mute/unmute functionality to control voice playback.\n\nTrade-offs and considerations:\n- Using the Web Speech API is free and doesn't require additional dependencies, but it may have limitations in voice quality and language support compared to paid TTS services.\n- We'll need to handle browser compatibility, as some older browsers might not support the Web Speech API.\n- We should consider adding a loading indicator while the voice is being synthesized and played.\n\nImplementation steps:\n1. Create a new utility function for text-to-speech conversion.\n2. Update the MessageList component to include a speak button for each assistant message.\n3. Modify the ChatMessages component to pass the necessary props and handle voice playback.\n4. Add a global mute/unmute button to the chat interface.\n\nShall we proceed with this plan?\n</PLANNING>",
